Transcendece is the point of exit from school and the bridge to the corporate world. 
This is a group project where we have to create a responsive **website** in `React` and `Nejst`

I'm in charge of **Authentication**, **Notification** and **Friendships**.


The site is far from perfect, but we've tried to make it a pleasant user experience.




## Features

- Real-time chat with admins, mute/ban/kick permissions, private and public channels and private messages. 
- Pong game with original rules, we offer the possibility to watch the game live
- Authentication with the ability to activate double authentication
- Receive real-time notifications. Manage profile information.
- We must be able to add friends, block them
- Responsive


## Tech Stack

**Client:** `React` `ChakraUI`

**Server:** `Node` `NestJs` `SocketIO`

**BDD:** `Pgadmin` `PosgreSQL`

## Optimizations

What I would have improved on my part:
- Sharing current user data using React context, refactoring the code into components.
- Separate requests from components
- Jwt management in the sessionStorage and adding a refresh token to avoid XSS failures.
